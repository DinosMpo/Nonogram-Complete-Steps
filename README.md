# Nonogram-Complete-Steps
This project is an assignement for my thesis. It's about the Nonogram game.
If you want to run the project you must download the node js from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Then you have to install the express.js and socket.io
on the versions express 4.17. socket.io 2.3.0. Then you run the command 'npm run start' and the project runs locally on the address http://localhost:8080/.
And you are ready.
